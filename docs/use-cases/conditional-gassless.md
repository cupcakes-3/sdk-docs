# Conditional Gasless

Users currently have to purchase multiple tokens to interact with DApps across different chains. It sometimes restricts users from trying out new applications and games built on chains for which they don’t have the native coin. With our conditional gasless feature, dapps can sponsor gas for their users with customised conditions for specific transactions.

## **How Would conditional gas work?**

DApps will have the ability to sponsor gas for selected transactions for their users, which can drive certain behaviour like better conversion rate, retention, or referral.

The three integrals part of the product will be:

- **SDK for front-end integration**
- **Paymaster Service which will sponsor and manage the gas.**
- **Dashboard and notifications for the dApp to manage the total gas spent, and leftover gas in the gas station.**

# **What all dapps can benefit from conditional gasless transactions?**

**Decentralized Exchanges** - Trading is a very high-frequency transaction activity. In the initial days, users only used DEXes to just swap tokens. But now decentralized order book exchanges like DyDx have enabled trading on DEXes. In order for trades to be executed seamlessly, a paymaster which enables transactions to go gasless becomes important. DEXes can set logic for what kind of trades to be sponsored and even give platform traders the flexibility to pay gas.

_For eg: 1inch is trying to refund gas for selected users on the mainnet. The current method is extremely inefficient and can be grossly improved via Account Abstraction. [To know more](https://blog.1inch.io/the-1inch-foundation-extends-the-gas-refund-program-c4b1f1970468)._

**Decentralized Games** - One of the initial blockers for users to try out new games is the gas fee that they have to incur for any in-game activities. This leads to potential user loss for the games. Through paymaster, games would be able to sponsor gas fees for new users and even sponsor gas for different types of users based on their in-game activity or progress. This will result in higher conversion and retention for the games.

**Airdrops - NFT and token** airdrops have been one of the popular marketing activities for dapps and protocols. For users to claim airdrops, they need to pay the gas, because of which sometimes users are not able to claim the airdrops. Dapps can use a paymaster to cover users’ gas fees and thus make sure 100% of users are delivered the NFTs/tokens to the users.

**What use cases dapps can use conditional gasless?**

User Acquisition - As a user acquisition campaign, a Dex can offer to pay gas for the first 10-15 transactions of a user and then pay 50% for the subsequent 10 transactions. A game might want to sponsor gas for new users till they are in stage 1 of the game and then conditionally sponsor gas for some actions in the game. A dApp running an NFT drop may choose to offer gasless transactions for the first 100 users claiming the NFT or for people who refer someone for the drop and hence helping the dApp acquire more users.

**User Retention** - A DeX can offer gasless transactions to all traders who have not traded in the last 15 days and hence activate dormant users through conditional gasless. Similarly, a game can activate players who have not been active on the game or not progressing through conditional gasless. A dAPP offering NFT drop might want to offer gasless minting to users who registered and didn’t mint the NFTs in the last drop.

**Increasing AOV** - Dexes can offer gasless transactions to traders who are trading a volume of more than 10 ETH hence pushing their trading volumes up via conditional gasless. Games can offer gasless to players who are buying in game accessories and hence boosting their in game sales.

**Driving loyalty** - Dexes can create a loyalty program for their traders offering gasless transactions to the most high volume trading wallets. Games can set reward daily active players, advance players offering them gasless transactions to drive certain player behaviour.

Create an edge over competition- Money saved is money earned and if a platform is offering gasless trades to a trader, that’s a lot of money saved for him. Running a dex is compeitive space to be in with so many dexes coming up, jumping on the wagon of coditional gasless early, offering traders gasless trades could be a great way to stand out and weed out the competition.
