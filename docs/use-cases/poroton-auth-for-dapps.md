# Proton Auth for Dapps

While integrating with a EOA wallet might be the easiest way for dapps to handle on chain transasctions, it comes at a cost of giving control over user’s onboarding journey and trusting your users to know how to navigate through complex EOA wallet user experience. With Proton that changes, you still get to keep all the transactions on blockchain, provide a non-custodial wallet to your users and also customise their onboarding process.

Proton is not a wallet but a wallet infrastructure that dapps can use and create their Games, Defi, NFT platform or any other kind of dapp.

With Proton your dapp essentially becomes a wallet. This is because you're doing all the transactions for the users by directly calling Proton functions and not any other wallet. This has the following advantages:

1. Dapp owns the whole walet experience for the user and the solution is completely whitelabel.
2. Dapps doon’t need to worry about building their own key infrastructure as the whole thing is taken care by Ptoton.
3. First-time users don't need the mental overhead of understanding the concept of a "wallet" to use your application. Just a standard Web2 login, they're onboarded using Proton!
4. Private key created through Proton can be used across all the chains which are currently supported by Proton
5. All transasctions on blockchain are done through your dapp specific wallet and you can keep the whole experience in one place
6. You can allow your users to pay gas with any token across chains which saves users a lot of hassle of swapping tokens
7. You can conditionally sponsor gas fees for users and reward them for a better experience
8. You can allow users to bundle multiple transactions into one single transaction simplifying the experience further.
