# Bundle Transactions

Bundling transactions opens up a plathora of possibilities. We have listed a few of them as example:

1. Users won't have to do two transactions for approving an ERC20 token & then depositing it.
2. You can easily support depositing of any ERC20 in your app. Just add a transaction to swap user's token to your preffered token using any Dex.
3. Modular Contract designs, deploy only specific contract modules and then join them off-chain using a bundler transactions.

**Cross-chain Bundling** will be coming soon, which will enable you to add bridging transactions to your transactions as well.
