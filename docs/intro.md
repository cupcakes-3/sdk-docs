# Introduction

Proton is an infra sdk for dapps to create their own white label non-custodial wallet with web2 like onboarding experience with social logins

## What does Proton do?

Proton let dapps create their own customised wallet experience for their users and enable social/email based logins and recovery which lead to a smother onboarding experience for the dapp user and hence improve their conversions. Proton has a mobile native SDK so the dapps can bring the non-custodial wallet experience to mobile.

They key management infrastructure is also provided by Proton and dapps just need to integrate a simple SDK to unlock all of this experience for their users.

### Features :

- **Social login (via MPC + SCW**) - We are the fist in industry to create MPC based smart contract wallet which also the enablement of social/email login. You will able to onboard users to your dapp just like a web2 platform and users can have a more familiar experience with a non- custodial wallet
- **Conditional sponsoring of gas (via paymaster)** - Dapps also have access to a dashboard where they can create their own paymaster to conditionally sponsor gas for certain user transactions. Dapps can custom build logics to set conditions for which they would want to sponsor the gas fees and leverage gas fees to conversion and retention of users
- **Pay gas with any token** - Since Proton creates a smart contract wallet for the dapp users, users would now be able to pay gas in any token on any chain and would not have to worry about getting the native token of the chain that they are transacting on.
- **Cross chain Bundling** - Dapps can bundle multiple transactions across chains into a single transactions and save multiple steps for both its users as well as internal ops.
- **Direct on ramp (via transek or moonpay)** - With Proton dapps can also enable onramp for their users. Proton is integrated with transek and with our SDK dapps can enable on ramp for their users in less than 5 minutes
